Post-Hoc Modification of Linear Models
==========

This Python package implements the post-hoc adaptation framework, as presented in van Vliet and Salmelin [1]_.

The code repository for this project can be found at: https://github.com/wmvanvliet/posthoc.

Documentation
-------------
A good place to get started with the package is to read through the `examples <auto_examples/index.html>`_.

Finally, there is the `API reference <api.html>`_ documentation.
